sometimes the javasctipt tat angular needs does not match the JS on the browsers so
this pollyfills.ts file filles the gap.

karma is a test runner for JS code.

tsconfig.json file holds settings for your typescript compiler.

tslintconfig.json holds settings for tslint, tslint check our TypeScript code for errors.

webpack puts all our styles and scripts in a bundle, and minifies that bundle, this is better for optimization.
when we change a file, webpack recompiles our application and refreshes out boundle and our browser.
webpack generates many boundles files like vendor.styles, polyfiels and injects them into our main html file.

a boundle has js code in it and it uses the styles for example if we are talking about the styles.boundle.js !!!
